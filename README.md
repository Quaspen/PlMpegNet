# PlMpegNet
PlMpegNet is C# port of the [pl_mpeg](https://github.com/phoboslab/pl_mpeg), which is C library to decode MPEG1 Video and MP2 Audio.

It is important to note, that this project is **port**(not **wrapper**). Original C code had been ported to C#. Therefore PlMpegNet doesnt require any native binaries.

The porting hasn't been done by hand, but using [Hebron](https://github.com/rds1983/Hebron), which is the C to C# code converter utility.
